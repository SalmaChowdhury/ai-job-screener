The AI Job Screener is a full-stack web application designed to help job seekers evaluate how well their resume matches a specific job description. 
Users upload both files, and the application uses the OpenAI GPT model to analyze and return detailed feedback on compatibility, strengths, and areas for improvement. 
This helps users better tailor their applications to increase their chances of getting interviews.

I learned how to integrate file upload functionality in both React and Express.

I got hands-on experience using the OpenAI API to process user-generated content.

I gained experience deploying a full-stack application, with the frontend on Vercel.

I practiced real-world Git usage, including branching, committing often, and writing clear messages.

I used ChatGPT to help me debug issues, write API logic, refine React code, and write documentation like this README.
